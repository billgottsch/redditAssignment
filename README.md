##Reddit Clone

I chose to do this Reddit API pull assignment for Overwatch, a very popular game created by Blizzard Entertainment. API calls were very new to us (potentially the first one we've done?) when this was created.

####What is it?
This project is to represent (or potentially clone) the look of the Overwatch Reddit forums. It brings in the live posts created, the title, who wrote it and a link to the physical post at Reddit.

####Why was it made?
This was our introduction to JQuery and AJAX calls for The Iron Yard. 


####Why keep it?
It truly shows me how far I've come from where I started before beginning the bootcamp. I may make a couple minor adjustments to it, but I hope to preserve the beginning of my learnings of Front-End Development to remind myself of just those things.
